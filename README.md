# calorie-tracker-app

This app is a basic dashboard essentially and I had created this to essentially learn these primary stuffs:

1. React JS
2. Redux - Saga
4. Spring Boot
5. Spring Security
6. Spring Data JPA

So, this dashboard will allow you to login and after logging in you will have the ability to add calories for any user, delete calories for any user, view all the users available. Currently the project has all the users with the ADMIN role.


Future Prospect:
1. To make the project more real life, I am planning to add more roles and render in the ReactJS UI the contents based on the role that the user has.
2. Currently the project uses H2 Database but I am planning to shift to a more sophisticated database like MySql or MongoDB
But until then, this is all of it

And so on, I am not posting all the CRUD functionalities for calorie

This project helped me a lot to learn about the basic functionalities of Spring and React and I'm pretty confident and planning to create a new project pretty soon
